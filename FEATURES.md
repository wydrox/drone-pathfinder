## Overview

WaypointMap is a web-based autonomous flight planning tool for DJI drones. It generates KMZ waypoint files that can be loaded onto compatible DJI drones for hands-off 3D mapping and mission planning.

- **Manual waypoint addition**: Add custom waypoints using the marker tool
- **Flight path straightening**: Align and straighten generated flight paths

### 2. Mission Configuration

- **Travel direction control**: Change generated flight direction (North-South / East-West)
- **Altitude adjustment**: Set and modify flight height for waypoints
- **Automatic altitude adjustment**: Premium feature - auto-adjust flight height based on terrain elevation changes
- **Action automation**: Generate waypoints with automatic photo capture actions

### 3. File Export & Import

- **KMZ file export**: Download DJI-compatible KMZ waypoint files

## Technical Implementation Notes

### File Transfer Workflow

1. Generate KMZ file on WaypointMap website
2. Connect DJI controller to computer via USB-C
3. Transfer KMZ file to controller:
   - **DJI RC 2/RC Pro**: Navigate to `Android/data/dji.go.v5/files/waypoint/`
   - **DJI RC-N series with iOS**: Save to `DJI Fly/wayline_mission/` folder
   - **DJI RC**: Use MicroSD card transfer
4. Replace existing KMZ file and rename to match

### Data Formats

- **KMZ**: Standard DJI waypoint file format (ZIP-compressed KML)
- **KML**: Keyhole Markup Language for geographic data

---

## Use Cases

1. **Large Scale Mapping**: Capture and map large swaths of land
2. **3D Photogrammetry**: Create points of interest for model scanning
3. **Videography**: Custom flight plans for video capture
4. **Automated Inspections**: Repeating inspection routes
5. **Survey Missions**: Systematic coverage of areas
